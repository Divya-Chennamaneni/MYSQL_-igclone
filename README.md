# MYSQL_-igclone

igclone is a pre-built social media app software that helps entrepreneurs to build an Instagram-like app. It's a simplified version of Instagram database.

	In the IG_clone database I used 7 entities (tables) like users, likes, posts, tags, follows, comments, photo tags to show the key relationship between Instagram's database.
	Its helps in understanding the relationship between different tables and how can we manipulate the data
	Used joins concepts for various tables like users and photos to analyse how likely the user in interested in using the application.
	Used subqueries and CTE’s to analyse the data about how many likes or comments each user got on their posts.
	Used various concepts like inner joins and correlated sub queries to find about what kind of hash tags did user used frequently.
	Created normalization forms to organise the data.
	Used functions and operators as per the requirement to analyse the data.
	Created stored procedures to run some daily activities.
	Created indexes to perform query optimization.
